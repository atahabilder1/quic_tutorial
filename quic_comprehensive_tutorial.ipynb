    "\n",
    "### What Does \"IP-Based\" Mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional protocols identify connections using **network-layer information**:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TCP (IP-Based Protocol)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Connection Identity = 4-tuple:\n",

    "│ 1. Source IP Address      (Layer 3)     │  ← From IP header\n",

    "│ 4. Destination Port       (Layer 4)     │  ← From TCP header\n",

    "  Connection = (192.168.1.100:50000 ↔ 203.0.113.50:443)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  If ANY of these 4 values change:\n",
    "    → Connection is broken!\n",
    "    → Must establish new connection\n",
    "    → New TCP handshake required\n",
    "    → New TLS handshake required\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UDP (Also IP-Based, but Connectionless)\n",

    "UDP doesn't maintain \"connections\" but still uses:\n",
    "┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**\n",
    "   - Uses TCP (IP-based)\n",
    "   - Control connection: client IP:port ↔ server IP:21\n",
    "   - Data connection: separate IP:port pairs\n",
    "   - If IP changes → both connections break\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SSH (Secure Shell)**\n",
    "   - Uses TCP (IP-based)\n",
    "   - Connection: client IP:port ↔ server IP:22\n",
    "   - If IP changes → connection drops, must reconnect\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SMTP (Email)**\n",
    "   - Uses TCP (IP-based)\n",
    "   - Connection: client IP:port ↔ server IP:25/587\n",
    "   - If IP changes → email transmission may fail\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **DNS**\n",
    "   - Uses UDP (IP-based, connectionless)\n",
    "   - Each query: client IP:port → DNS server IP:53\n",
    "   - No persistent connection, so no migration issue\n",
    "   - But no connection state either!\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **WebRTC (Modern P2P)**\n",
    "   - Uses UDP + DTLS\n",
    "   - Still IP-based, but has ICE protocol for migration\n",
    "   - More complex than QUIC's approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**All traditional connection-oriented protocols (TCP-based) suffer from:**\n",
    "- Network path changes break connections\n",
    "- Mobile users experience frequent disconnections\n",
    "- No seamless handoff between networks\n",
    "- Poor experience for modern mobile applications\n",

    "### Why This Is Problematic for Firewalls\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Connection State Tracking**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   TCP: Firewall tracks SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK\n",
    "        Can see connection establishment\n",
    "        Can enforce connection policies\n",
    "   \n",
    "   QUIC: UDP is stateless\n",
    "         First packet looks like any UDP packet\n",
    "         Firewall can't distinguish QUIC from other UDP\n",
    "         Can't track \"connection\" lifecycle\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Connection ID is Opaque**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   TCP: 4-tuple uniquely identifies connection\n",
    "        Firewall can correlate packets\n",
    "   \n",
    "   QUIC: Connection ID is arbitrary bytes\n",
    "         Can change during connection (rotation)\n",
    "         Multiple Connection IDs for same connection\n",
    "         Firewall can't reliably track without deep state\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Everything Is Encrypted**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   TLS over TCP:\n",
    "     - Handshake partially visible\n",
    "     - SNI visible in ClientHello\n",
    "     - Certificate visible\n",
    "   \n",
    "   QUIC:\n",
    "     - EVERYTHING encrypted except:\n",
    "       • Connection ID\n",
    "       • Packet type (long/short header)\n",
    "       • Version number (initial packets)\n",
    "     - Even SNI is encrypted! (via ECH - Encrypted ClientHello)\n",
    "     - Firewall is essentially blind\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Migration Confuses Tracking**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   TCP: Same 4-tuple for entire connection\n",
    "        Easy to track and filter\n",
    "   \n",
    "   QUIC: IP/port can change mid-connection\n",
    "         Same Connection ID, different 5-tuple\n",
    "         Firewall sees \"new\" flow\n",
    "         Can't correlate with old flow\n",
    "         May incorrectly block or allow\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No Standard Port**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Traditional protocols:\n",
    "     - HTTP: port 80\n",
    "     - HTTPS: port 443\n",
    "     - SSH: port 22\n",
    "     - FTP: port 21\n",
    "   \n",
    "   QUIC:\n",
    "     - Usually port 443 (same as HTTPS)\n",
    "     - But can use ANY port\n",
    "     - UDP/443 could be QUIC or something else\n",
    "     - Can't distinguish without DPI\n",
    "   ```\n"

    "NAT sees:\n",
    "  1. SYN packet (connection start)\n",
    "     → Create mapping\n",
    "     → Set timeout (long, e.g., 2 hours)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  2. Data packets\n",
    "     → Refresh timeout on each packet\n",
    "  \n",
    "  3. FIN/RST packets (connection end)\n",
    "     → Remove mapping immediately\n",
    "     → Free port for reuse\n",
    "  \n",
    "  4. Timeout (no packets)\n",
    "     → Remove mapping\n",
    "     → Client will see connection reset on next packet\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### QUIC Through NAT (Problematic)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "NAT sees:\n",
    "  1. First UDP packet (no connection state!)\n",
    "     → Can't tell if this is connection start\n",
    "     → Can't tell if this is QUIC or other UDP protocol\n",
    "     → Must guess: create mapping\n",
    "     → Set timeout (short for UDP, e.g., 30s)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  2. More UDP packets\n",
    "     → Refresh timeout\n",
    "     → But UDP timeout is SHORT\n",
    "     → If no packets for 30s, mapping removed\n",
    "  \n",
    "  3. No visible connection termination\n",
    "     → NAT can't tell if connection ended\n",
    "     → Must wait for timeout\n",
    "     → Wastes port mappings\n",
    "  \n",
    "  4. After NAT timeout (mapping removed):\n",
    "     → Next packet from client gets NEW external port\n",
    "     → Server sees packet from DIFFERENT IP:port\n",
    "     → This triggers MIGRATION!\n",
