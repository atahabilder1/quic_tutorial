    "### For Research on Server Mobility\n",
    "\n",
    "Most QUIC migration literature focuses on **client-side migration** (mobile devices switching networks).\n",

    "This notebook focuses on **SERVER-SIDE migration** - when the server changes its address.\n",

    "## What is Server-Side Migration?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Client-side migration (common):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Client moves:  WiFi → Cellular\n",
    "Server stays:  Same address\n",
    "Who initiates: Client\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why Would a Server Migrate?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Balancing**\n",
    "   - Server overloaded\n",
    "   - Migrate connections to less-loaded server\n",
    "   - Distribute traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Planned Maintenance**\n",
    "   - Need to take server offline\n",
    "   - Migrate active connections to backup server\n",
    "   - Zero downtime\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Failure Recovery**\n",
    "   - Primary server fails\n",
    "   - Failover to backup server\n",
    "   - Continue serving clients\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Geographic Optimization**\n",
    "   - Client moved geographically\n",
    "   - Migrate to closer server\n",
    "   - Reduce latency\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Network Reconfiguration**\n",
    "   - Data center network changes\n",
    "   - Server gets new IP address\n",
    "   - Connections should survive\n",

    "6. **Anycast Routing Changes**\n",
    "   - BGP routing changes\n",
    "   - Client routed to different anycast instance\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Migration Latency**\n",
    "   - Time from preferred_address sent to client migrated\n",
    "   - Typical: 1-2 RTT\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Success Rate**\n",
    "   - Percentage of clients that successfully migrate\n",
    "   - Target: >95%\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fallback Rate**\n",
    "   - Percentage that couldn't reach preferred address\n",
    "   - Indicates network accessibility issues\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Application Impact**\n",
    "   - Does user notice migration?\n",

    "### Server-Side Migration Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Proactive, not Reactive**\n",
    "   - Server initiates, client responds\n",
    "   - Planned, controlled migration\n",
    "   - During handshake or later with NEW_CONNECTION_ID\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Cases**\n",
    "   - Load balancer bypass\n",

    "   - Planned maintenance\n",
    "   - Geographic optimization\n",
    "   - Anycast routing\n",

    "3. **Mechanism**\n",
    "   - preferred_address transport parameter\n",
    "   - New Connection ID\n",
    "   - Client validates before migrating\n",

    "4. **Benefits**\n",
    "   - Zero-downtime maintenance\n",
    "   - Efficient load balancing\n",
    "   - Direct server access\n",
    "   - Graceful failover\n",

    "5. **Challenges**\n",
    "   - Client may not reach preferred address (firewall/NAT)\n",
