# Project Summary - QUIC Server-Side Migration Research

## 🎯 Your Research Focus

**SERVER-SIDE MIGRATION** - When the server changes its address, not the client.

**NOT client-side migration** (that's when users switch networks like WiFi→Cellular).

**Quick Start:** Read `START_HERE.md` first! It tells you exactly how to run everything.

## Key Concepts for Your Paper

### Server-Side vs Client-Side Migration

| Aspect | Client-Side | Server-Side (YOUR FOCUS) |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Who moves?** | Client changes network | Server changes address |
| **Who initiates?** | Client (forced by network) | Server (intentional) |
| **When?** | Anytime (when network changes) | During handshake |
| **Mechanism** | Same Connection ID, new IP | Preferred Address parameter |
| **Common?** | Very common (mobile) | Less common (data centers) |
| **Use case** | User mobility | Infrastructure management |
| **RFC Section** | RFC 9000 §9 | RFC 9000 §9.6 |

### Server-Side Migration Use Cases

1. **Load Balancer Bypass**
   - Client connects to LB
   - Server tells client to connect directly
   - Bypasses LB for data transfer
   - Only handshake goes through LB

2. **Server Failover**
   - Primary server needs maintenance
   - Tells all clients to migrate to backup
   - Zero downtime
   - Graceful migration

3. **Geographic Optimization**
   - Client moved location
   - Migrate to closer server
   - Lower latency

4. **Network Reconfiguration**
   - Data center IP changes
   - Connections survive
   - No re-handshake

### How It Works (Preferred Address)

```
1. Client connects to: 203.0.113.50:443 (public/LB)

2. Server sends in handshake:
   Transport Parameter: preferred_address
     IPv4: 10.0.1.100:443 (internal/direct)
     Connection ID: NEW_CID_XYZ
     Token: [stateless reset]

3. Client validates: 10.0.1.100:443
   Sends PATH_CHALLENGE
   Receives PATH_RESPONSE

4. Client migrates to: 10.0.1.100:443
   Uses NEW_CID_XYZ
   Direct connection!

5. LB bypassed for all future packets
```

### Research Questions You Can Address

1. **Performance**
   - How fast is server-side migration?
   - Latency impact?
   - Packet loss during migration?

2. **Reliability**
   - Success rate of preferred address migration?
   - What if preferred address unreachable?
   - Fallback mechanisms?

3. **Scalability**
   - Can server migrate 10,000 clients?
   - Batch migration strategies?
   - Load impact on servers?

4. **Real-World Deployment**
   - Load balancer integration?
   - CDN use cases?
   - Data center operations?

5. **Comparison**
   - TCP server migration (must reconnect)
   - QUIC client migration (reactive)
   - QUIC server migration (proactive)

### Metrics to Measure

For your paper, measure:

1. **Migration Latency**
   - Time from preferred_address to migration complete
   - Typical: 1-2 RTT (~50-100ms)

2. **Success Rate**
   - Percentage of successful migrations
   - Target: >95%

3. **Fallback Rate**
   - When preferred address fails
   - Indicates network issues

4. **Load Balancer Savings**
   - Packets bypassing LB
   - CPU/bandwidth savings
   - Scalability improvement

5. **User Experience**
   - Application disruption
   - Perceived latency
   - Connection stability
